                <h1>Vandal</h1>
                <p>The Vandal is a fully automatic rifle that sits at 2,900 Credits. It is the counterpart to the Phantom, and is unique for its high DPS at any range. It is incredibly lethal due to its ability to kill opponents with one shot to the head at all ranges. Like other rifles, one can aim down the sights (ADS) to reduce spread at the cost of fire rate.</p>

            <div class="phantom">
                <h1>Phantom</h1>
                <p>The Phantom is a fully automatic rifle that sits at 2,900 Credits. It does less damage per bullet than its counterpart, the Vandal, but makes up for it with its above average accuracy, low spread, high rate of fire and a Silencer.</p>

            <div class="classic">
                <h1>Classic</h1>
                <p>The Classic is the pistol that all players receive upon spawning. Compared to most other weapons, the Classic does a meager amount of damage. However, its nonexistent price tag makes it effective for rounds in which the player or team wishes to save credits for later rounds.</p>

                <p>Phoenix is an offensive VALORANT agent, who specializes in hunting down enemies, while crippling their ability to fire back. The Blaze ability creates walls that blocks vision and deals damage, allowing Phoenix to sneak past defended open areas, while Curveball blinds enemies, even if they're hinding behind corners.</p>
